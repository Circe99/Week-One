# *Canadian Digital Archaeology: On Boundaries and Futures*
  
  "Likewise, there are those who argue that digital archae-ology should be recognized as a distinct subfield  (Graham  et  al.  2017),  which  stands  in  contrast  with  those  who  see  it  as permeable or universal to all archaeol-ogy (Evans et al. 2006:7)."
   
   I find this to be such a facinating perspecive, I personally believe digital archaeology is absolutely universal, and should be used more to allow more access for the public to experience and learn without the risk of damage (which can simply happen with time no matter how hard someone tries to preserve an artifact)
  Great example would be the Ingenium digital archives program https://ingeniumcanada.org/education/3d-educational-resources which allows people to even print the artifact at home and experience it for themselves

   “Virtual  Repatriation” after looking up this term I can see the issues with access when dealing with an online format and creating a space that is open and accessable whilst still being respectful of the things we choose to post. (this is true for anything that is on the internet)
   
# *So what is Digital Archaeology?*

  Overall this was a great basis for the start of this course. 
  
  Virtual Machine. I have already defined this term in my things-I've-learned.md, but I am very intregued by this concept of a computer inside of a computer. I wonder in what ways will it be useful, how does it work (from a coding perspective), and is it more affective than other means of dealing with digital archaeology? I hope to answer some of my questions later on as we start to work with this. 
  
# *EmboDIYing Disruption: Queer, Feminist and Inclusive Digital Archaeologies*
  
  "some people are forced to take on more risk than others. The lines of privilege and power are far more insidious in our technology-drenched worlds than those who benefit from it care to recognize, let alone address, and there is a very troubling pattern intensifying before our eyes."
  
  This text reminds me of the Canadian Digital Archaeology text when speaking of the issues with diversity in both Digital and Traditional Archaeology. I find it hard to believe that there is still discrimination (in any field), but especially when dealing with a subject like archaeology where diversity would be a huge asset. The range in cultures and perspectives would allow for a more well rounded system that would deal with the issue of "Virtual Repatriation".
